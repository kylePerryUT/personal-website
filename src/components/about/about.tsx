          I’m a software engineer with three years of experience and a degree in
          computer science. I have strong skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
          TypeScript, and React, and I enjoy creating easy-to-use, beautiful
          websites. I’ve also worked with Angular, C#, .NET, SQL Server, Go, and
          MongoDB, which has given me a broader understanding of both front-end
          and back-end development.
          <br />

          I’m a great communicator and work well with different teams, ensuring
          that projects run smoothly. I’m always open to feedback from peers and
          managers, as I believe it’s essential for my growth and improvement.
